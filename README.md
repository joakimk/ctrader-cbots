# ctrader-cbots

These are some of the algorithmic trading bots I've written for use with cTrader.

There is no guarantee of any kind that they will work for you. Do your own backtesting in cTrader and only risk what you are comfortable loosing. Also it's a good idea to run them on demo mode before risking any real money.
